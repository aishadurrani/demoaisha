	<p> My name is Aisha Durrani, I am a student in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Jan 2016</p>
	<p>"I have been in banking for almost 8 years and now I"ve decided to try something new.  I'm very artistic and love creating things such as paintngs, candles, abstract art and more.   Although this seems like a difficult challenge I hope maybe one day I can conquer it.   Maybe I'll be confident enough to teach a class like my Instructor Ahmed Haque lolll yeah I know thats a far fetched thought but you never know ;)</p>

	<p>Thats all about me for now!!!</p>
